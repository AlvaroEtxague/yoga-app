    <h2>Our story</h2>
    <p>Himalaya Yoga Valley has been in the business of Yoga Training for over 12 years and in that time have trained over 2500 yoga teachers from all over the world. </p>
    <p>We started life in India where our school Director Yogacharya Lalit has been studying yoga since the age of seven. The name Himalaya Yoga Valley came from our humble beginnings in the Himalayan town of Dharamshala where we had our first ever school.</p>
    <p>Our main Training and Retreat Centre is now based in the beautiful fishing village of Mandrem, North Goa, where we hold our world-renowned yoga teacher trainings, retreats and professional development programmes. We also recently celebrated our seventh anniversary in Cork, Ireland where we have two thriving yoga studios.</p>
